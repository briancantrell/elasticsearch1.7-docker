Elasticsearch 1.7 with Sense
============================

I got tired of mucking around installing this Elasticsearch 1.7 and a compatible version of Sense.

First:
`> docker-compose up`

Access Sense here:
http://localhost:5601/app/sense

You will need to set Sense's server to http://elasticsearch:9200
